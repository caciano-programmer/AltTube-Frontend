# AlttubeFrontend
 This is the front-end of a video hosting and sharing applicaion. Sort of like a bare bones version of youtube, you can: upload videos, create and edit your account so other can know more about you, leave comments on videos, etc. Also each video has a live chat feature built on web sockets that allows communication in real time.
